# Introduction

Python and Jupyter Notebook code for Astronomical analysis. Written by Eric G. Suchanek, Ph.D.
in affiliation with the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy (MIRA).

## Getting Started

This library has been developed using *Anaconda* and has been tested under OSX 10.15, Ubuntu 18.04, Windows 7 Professional
and Windows 10. I have used Microsoft's *Visual Studio Code* IDE for development and have been in general quite pleased with it. It plays well with Anaconda and can correctly use the virtual python environment described below.

*NB:* As with any Python project there are a number of libraries that must be installed. Anaconda/conda greatly facilitates this process. This will be described more fully below:

## Base Environment Installation

1. Install Anaconda (<http://anaconda.org>)

2. Install VisualStudio Code (<https://code.visualstudio.com/download>)

3. Build the environment
    - Library dependencies
        - astropy
        - astroquery
        - astroml
        - ipyvol
        - ipyaladin
        - plotly
        - plotly_express
        - scikit-learn

4. Latest releases
    - the current master branches has the latest working release

5. API references
